## ChefsHatGym V3

This repository holds the ChefsHatGym2 environment, which contains all the necessary tools to run, train and evaluate your agents while they play the Chef`s Hat game.

With this library, you will be able to:

* Encapsulate existing agents into the game
* Run the game locally, on your machine
* Run the game room as a server
* Connect agents to a server room and run games
* Export experimental results, game summaries and agents behavior on a easy-to-read format
* Evaluate agents using different evaluation tools and visualizations

Full documentation can be found here: [Documentation.](https://chefshatgym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We also provide a list of existing plugins and extensions for this library:

### Chef`s Hat Run

The [Chef’s Hat Run](https://github.com/pablovin/chefsHat_run) is a web interface that allows the setup, follow-up and management of server-based rooms of the Chef\`s Hat. It is ideal to run local experiments with artificial agents, without the need to configure or code anything; To run server rooms and allow remote players to player; And to explore finished games, by using the interative plotting tools to visualize and extract important game statistics.

### Chef`s Hat Players Club

The [Chef’s Hat Player’s Club](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatPlayersClub) is a collection of ready-to-use artificial agents. These agents were implemented, evaluated, and discussed in specific peer-reviewed publications and can be used anytime. If you want your agent to be included in the Player’s Club, message us.

### Chef`s Hat Play

[Chef`s Hat Play](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHat_Play) is a Unity interface that allows humans to play the game against other humans or artificial agents.

### Metrics Chef`s Hat

The [Metrics Chef`s Hat](https://github.com/lauratriglia/MetricsChefsHat) package includes the tools for creating different game behavior metrics that help to better understand and describe the agents. Developed and maintained by Laura Triglia.


### Nova

[Nova](https://github.com/nathaliarcauas/Nova) is a dynamic game narrator, used to describe and comment on a Chef`s Hat game. Developed and mantained by Nathalia Cauas.


### Simulated Games

We also provide a series of simulated games, inside the [Simulated Games.](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatGYM/tree/master/Simulated_Games) folder.
Each of these games run for 1000 matches, and different combination of agents play them. They are provided as a ready-to-use resource for agent analysis, tools development or better understanding of the Chef`s Hat Simulator as a whole.


## The Chef's Hat Card game

![Chef's Hat Card Game](gitImages/cardGame.jpg) 

The Chef's Hat Environment provides a simple and easy-to-use API, based on the OpenAI GYM interface, for implementing, embedding, deploying, and evaluating reinforcement learning agents.

Fora a complete overview on the development of the game, refer to:

- It's Food Fight! Introducing the Chef's Hat Card Game for Affective-Aware HRI (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11458)
- You Were Always on My Mind: Introducing Chef’s Hat and COPPER for Personalized Reinforcement Learning (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2021.669990/full)
- The Chef's Hat rulebook  [The Chef's Hat rulebook.](gitImages/RulebookMenuv08.pdf)

If you want to have access to the game materials (cards and playing field), please contact us using the contact information at the end of the page.

## Chef`sHatGym Simulator

![Chef's Hat Card Game](gitImages/ChefsHat_GYM_-_Example_Random_Agent.gif) 

### Instalation

You can use our pip installation:

```python
   pip install chefshatgym

```
Refer to our full [documentation](https://chefshatgym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a complete usage and development guide.
 

### Running a game locally
The basic structure of the simulator is a room, that will host four players, and initialize the game.
ChefsHatGym2 encapsulates the entire room structure, so it is easy to create a game using just a few lines of code:

```python
    # Start the room
    room = ChefsHatRoomLocal(
        room_name="local_room",
        verbose=False,
    )

    # Create the players
    p1 = AgentRandonLocal(name="01")
    p2 = AgentRandonLocal(name="02")
    p3 = AgentRandonLocal(name="03")
    p4 = AgentRandonLocal(name="04")

    # Adding players to the room
    for p in [p1, p2, p3, p4]:
        room.add_player(p)

    # Start the game
    info = room.start_new_game(game_verbose=True)

```

For a more detailed example, check the [examples folder.](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatGYM/tree/master/examples).

### Running a game remotely

ChefsHatGym2 allows the creation of a gameroom server. Agents running in different machines can connect to the room server via simple TCP connection. A server room structure and remote agents is supported by the library, as shown in our [examples folder](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatGYM/tree/master/examples/remoteRoom).

### Chefs Hat Agents

ChefsHatGym2 provides an interface to encapsulate agents. It allows the extension of existing agents, but also the creation of new agents. Implementing from this interface, allow your agents to be inserted in any Chef`s Hat game run by the simulator.

Runing an agent from another machine is supported directly by the ChefsHat agent interface. By implementing this interface, your agent gets all the local and remote agent functionality and can be used by the Chef`s Hat simulator. 


Here is an example of an agent that only select random actions:
* [Random Agent](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatGYM/blob/master/src/ChefsHatGym/agents/agent_random.py)


## Legacy Plugins and Extensions

 ### Chef's Hat Online (ChefsHatGymV1)
   ![Plots Example](gitImages/exampleOnline.png)
   
The [Chef’s Hat Online](https://github.com/pablovin/ChefsHatOnline) encapsulates the Chef’s Hat Environment and allows a human to play against three agents. The system is built using a web platform, which allows you to deploy it on a web server and run it from any device. The data collected by the Chef’s Hat Online is presented in the same format as the Chef’s Hat Gym, and can be used to train or update agents, but also to leverage human performance.
 
 ### Moody Framework (ChefsHatGymV1)
 
  ![Plots Example](gitImages/MoodPlotsExample.png)
  
 [Moody Framework]( https://github.com/pablovin/MoodyFramework) is a plugin that endowes each agent with an intrinsic state which is impacted by the agent's
  own actions.
